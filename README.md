## Data and Algorithms

The system utilizes movie information and user interactions (ratings, reviews, and preferences) to generate movie recommendations. Two main algorithms are employed:

#### Collaborative Filtering: This technique analyzes user interactions to identify users with similar tastes and suggests movies based on their collective preferences.
#### Content-Based Filtering: The system suggests movies similar to those previously liked by the user, based on movie attributes such as genres, actors, and directors.

In addition, it utilizes cosine similarity to measure the similarity between users' preferences and sentiment analysis to understand users' reviews and feedback
